## Summary
The work in [1] considers a Bayesian approach to the task of inferring the unknown initial state of a linear dynamical system based on noisy linear measurements taken after the initial time. The initial state is endowed with a Gaussian prior and measurement noise is also assumed to be Gaussian, so that the Bayesian posterior is also Gaussian. We define a <b>balanced truncation for Bayesian inference</b> model reduction approach and show that the resulting reduced models inherit stability and error guarantees from the system-theoretic setting, and in some settings yield an optimal posterior covariance approximation as defined in [2].

## Examples
To generate the plots from the paper, run the *_plot{1,2}.m scripts, corresponding to:
* heat_plot1.m: The heat equation example with 500,000 measurements spaced 10^-4 seconds apart (Figure 5.1) -- this example may take a minute or two to run.
* heat_plot2.m: The heat equation example with 100 measurements spaced 0.1 seconds apart (Figure 5.2)
* iss_plot1.m: The ISS example with 3000 measurements spaced 0.1 seconds apart (Figure 5.3)
* iss_plot2.m: The ISS example with 10 measurements spaced 1 second apart (Figure 5.4)
